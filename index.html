                       Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It 
                    supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and 
                    easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
                    Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it 
                    attractive for Application Development.
                    Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for 
                    scripting and rapid application development.
                    Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and 
                    functional or procedural programming styles.
                    Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it 
                    is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 
                    3D CAD, etc.
                    We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can 
                    write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
                    Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step 
                    included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast
